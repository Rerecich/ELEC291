# ELEC 291 - Electrical Engineering Design Studio I

This repository showcases some of my project work in ELEC 291, an electrical design course at UBC. This demonstrates some of the evolution of my understanding, as most of the content was new to me while I was taking the course. I have decided to leave the organization and general execution as-is so I always have something to look back on. 

## Overview of Topics

1. [Assembly Language](#assembly-language)
2. [Reflow Ovens](#reflow-ovens)
3. [Microcontrollers and C](#microcontrollers-and-C)
4. [Electromagnetics, Electronic Circuits](#electromagnetics,-electronic-circuits)
5. [Signals and Systems](#signals-and-systems)

### Assembly Language

(Labs 1-3) - Explored the intricacies of assembly language programming, applying low-level coding and optimization techniques.

### Reflow Ovens

(Project 1) - Designed, constructed, and programmed a Reflow Oven Controller that we used to construct our own PCB.

### Microcontrollers and C

(All) - Developed practical skills working with various microcontrollers and processors, including the EFM8 and ATmega328 systems.

### Electromagnetics, Electronic Circuits

(Project 2) - Explored the fundamentals of electromagnetics, applying concepts to build a transmitter and receiver directly on our breadboards with basic circuit components.

### Signals and Systems

(Project 2) - Applied the principles of signals and systems, used Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) to control a robotic car.
